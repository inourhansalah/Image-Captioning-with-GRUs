# Image-Captioning-with-GRUs
This project generates image captions using a deep learning model combining convolutional and recurrent architectures. The model is trained on the **Flickr8k** dataset and utilizes **EfficientNet**, **GRU**, and **tokenization techniques** to describe image content in natural language.
